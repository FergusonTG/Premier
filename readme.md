# Premier — track team scores in the Premier League

This was originally created to look at clustering of points in the Premier League, as the top teams pull away from the middle, and as the bottom teams fall away behind. Unfortunately it only lasted one season until my interest in the EPL waned!

Still it works and you can run it.

## Running the program

Don’t forget to activate the pipenv shell before running. 

Premier relies on python 3.

Start <code>python aioPremier.py</code> for the async version or <code>python graph.py</code> for the blocking one.
